Registration Application
The Registration Application is a Java-based CRUD application designed to manage user registrations. It provides functionalities to perform the following operations:

1.Create: Users can register by providing their name, city, email, and mobile number through a user-friendly interface. Upon submission, the application stores this information in a database.
2.Read: Registered users' information can be retrieved from the database and displayed to the user. This functionality allows users and administrators to view existing registrations.
3.Update: Users can modify their registration details, such as their name, city, email, or mobile number. The application allows users to update their information, ensuring data accuracy and relevance.
4.Delete: Users or administrators can delete existing registrations from the database. This feature is useful for removing outdated or incorrect information.
